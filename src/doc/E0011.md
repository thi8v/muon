# Error `E0011`

```
let c1 = "\uDD";
let c2 = "\u{}";
let c3 = "\u{100000000}";
let c4 = "\u{DFFF}";
```

In this erroneous example:
* `c1` doesn't have enclosing braces: `{` and `}`
* `c2` contains no digits between `{` and `}`
* `c3` the value exceeds what 32 bits can store
* `c4` the value is a surrogate and thus cannot be represented
